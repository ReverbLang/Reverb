# Reverb

Welcome to the introduction markdown document for Reverb. In this document, i will guide you through Reverb and how you can use it for your next big project!

# Chapter 1, What, Why, Who?
Hello, my name is Sakata, i have been a developer for a little while now (as of September 16th 2024 it has been a few months since i started "developing"). Reverb is my newest "big" project where i aim to make a programming language thats in a kind of sweet spot between "beginner friendly" and "not beginner friendly". This language will be more or so similar to C/C++ so buckle up!
